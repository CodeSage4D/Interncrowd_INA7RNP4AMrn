Here's a high-level algorithm for a simple calculator:

Create a GUI window for the calculator.

Initialize the necessary components, including a text field for input and buttons for numbers, operators, and the equal sign.

When a number button is clicked, append the corresponding number to the input field.

When an operator button is clicked, store the current number from the input field and the selected operator.

When the equal button is clicked, evaluate the expression based on the stored number and operator.

Display the result in the input field.

Handle any error cases, such as division by zero or invalid expressions.

Provide a clear button to reset the input field.

Run the calculator GUI.

Continuously repeat steps 3 to 9 until the user exits the calculator.

This algorithm provides a general outline for a simple calculator. You can further refine and enhance it based on your specific requirements, such as adding more advanced operations or functions.
